Kim M. Simons is a multi-award winning, master level cake artist and food artist. She and her teammates--The Bah Hum Bakers--were the champions of Food Network's HOLIDAY WARS (Dec. 2019).

Kim was part of the winning duo on CAKE WARS: STAR WARS (2016). She has competed on TV's CAKE WARS: CHRISTMAS, SUGARDOME, DUFF TILL DAWN, HALLOWEEN WARS, CAKEALIKES, THE BIG BAKE, CAKE TOPPERS, and OUTRAGEOUS WEDDING CAKES II. She also appeared on Telemundo’s BUENAS DIAS NUEVA YORK, where she presented one of her fabulous cakes to a live television audience in celebration of their first show.

Kim has been recognized by “Dessert Professional” magazine as one of the Top-Ten Cake Artists in North America (2013). Her creations have also been featured in the magazines “Cake Masters,” “American Cake Decorating,” “Today’s Woman,” and “Cake Design: France.” She has more victories in national cake shows than she can count.

More recently, Kim has received accolades for her contributions to Sullivan County's DOVE TRAIL. Kim painted sixteen-and-a-half of the 90 gigantic fiberglass doves installed throughout the county in honor of the 50th Anniversary of the Woodstock Festival in Bethel, NY. She is the author of a cookbook of gluten-free recipes called GET ALL COOK-Y WITH KIM.

Kim is not a traditional cake artist. She enjoys creating unique and beautiful cakes and food art while pushing the limits of construction and design. Her strengths include designing, painting with edible colors, and sculpting incredibly realistic nature scenes. Kim has a reputation for creating amazingly realistic animals out of sugar which has earned her the respect of her peers.

Friendly, knowledgeable, and entertaining, Kim teaches classes and performs demonstrations all over the country.
